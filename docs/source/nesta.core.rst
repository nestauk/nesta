How to put code into production at nesta
----------------------------------------

Note: this is being actively developed.

1. Audit the package code, required to pass all auditing tests
2. Understand what environment is required
3. Write a Dockerfile and docker launch script for this under scripts/docker_recipes
4. Build the Docker environment (run:      docker_build <recipe_name>  from any directory)
5. Build and test the batchable(s)
6. Build and test a Luigi pipeline
7. [...] Need to have steps here which estimate run time cost parameters. Could use tests.py to estimate this. [...]
8. Run the full chain
