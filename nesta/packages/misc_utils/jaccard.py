jaccard
=======

Tools for measuring Jaccard similarity, specifically designed
for fast fuzzy matching via SetSimilaritySearch.

This uses a "fuzzy" intersection in a redefinition of the Jaccard similarity. To understand, consider the two sets:

    a = {"open", "university"}
    b = {"apen", "university"}

The regular Jaccard similarity between these is 1/3. Instead, if we define the similarity score as the sum of the closest jaccard matches between the terms:

   jaccard("open", "apen") ==> 3/5
   jaccard("university", "university") ==> 1

Then the total Jaccard similarity can be reinterpretted as (3/5 + 1)/2 = 8/10. Using this via SetSimilaritySearch offers significant speed-ups with respect to fuzzywuzzy.
